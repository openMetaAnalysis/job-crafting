Job crafting
============================================
A living systematic review

Short url: https://ebmgt.github.io/job-crafting/

**Definitions** 
* "Job crafting" is "self-initiated behaviours that employees take to shape, mold, and change their jobs" ([van Leeuwen, 2022](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19095666))​ Another definition is, "workers actively change the actual or perceived characteristics of their jobs in order to better match the demands placed on them and the resources available" (Topa and Aranda-Carmena, 2022 PMID [36232011](http://pubmed.gov/36232011)). Another description is "improving person-job fit" (Kuijpers, 2019 PMID [31829662](http://pubmed.gov/31829662)).
* "Collaborative job crafting" is "[workers] can jointly determine how to modify the work to meet their shared goals" (Topa and Aranda-Carmena, 2022 PMID [36232011](http://pubmed.gov/36232011))​
* "Team job crafting" is the “extent to which team members combine efforts to increase structural and social job resources as well as challenging job demands, and to decrease their hindering job demands” (Dejong et al. J J Appl Psychol. 2024 PMID [39325376](http://pubmed.gov/39325376)
* Job crafting can be combined with "knowledge sharing", such as Googler2Googler (G2) in which the organization helps disseminate successful job crafting.

**Measurement of the occurence of job crafting**

Kuijpers (2019 PMID [31829662](http://pubmed.gov/31829662)) states the following targets or goals of the individual exist and can be measured by the survey of Kooij (2017, PMID [28277726](http://pubmed.gov/28277726)). Crafting towards:
  * Strengths of the individual
  * Interests of the individual
  * Development of the individual
  * Efficiency of the work process via adoption crafting (not part of Kuijpers's model) is the "active and goal-directed use of technology and other sources of knowledge to optimize the work process and is more aimed at doing the job more efficiently than at realizing one’s potential." (Kooij, 2017 PMID [28277726](http://pubmed.gov/28277726))

 Petrou (Petrou et al., 2012 DOI: [10.1002/job.1783](http://doi.org/10.1002/job.1783)), alternatively proposed the Job Crafting Scale which measures the following targets or goals of the individual
 * Challenges (increasing)
 * Resources (increasing)
 * Demands (reduction)

Tims (Tims, 2012 DOI [10.1016/j.jvb.2011.05.009](http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvb.2011.05.009)) Dutch job crafting scale (JCS) based on the job demands-resources model (Demerouti, 2001 PMID [11419809](http://pubmed.gov/11419809)) measures:
 increasing social job resources, increasing structural job resources, increasing challenging job demands, and decreasing hindering job demands.
* Demands, hindering (decreasing hindering job demands)
* Demands, challenging  (increasing challenging job demands)
* Resources, social
* Resources, structural

**Clinical summary:** Our original objective of this meta-analysis was to measure the impact of job crafting on burnout. Two studies of emotional exhaustion with less than 200 total subjects suggests a '[moderate](https://training.cochrane.org/handbook/current/chapter-15#section-15-5-3-1)' reduction with a standized mean difference (SMD) of -0.49 (interpreting SMDs); however, this insignificant in the small population studied. Additional results are below. 

Heterogeneity of results as measured by I<sup>2</sup> '[might not be important](https://training.cochrane.org/handbook/current/chapter-10#section-10-10-2)' at 0% for all outcomes; however very wide confidence intervals reflect the small number of studies and subjects. 

Meta-regression of common modulators (year of publication, study size, event rate in the control groups) has not been done due to the small number of studies.
